# eeg-database-for-android-gradle-build-for-gsoc-2015
This is the gradle build for the EEG database for GSOC 2015

EEG Portal for Android is native Android application for ICS or higher. Its goal is to provide basic features vital for EEG/ERP research like adding new subject, create scenario, or upload measured data into database.

In GSOC 2015, a new feature for this app will be added, a local database inside the app that enables it to work offline and a auto-data-sync functionality which enable the app to sync local data with the server and vise versa. 
Moreover, a flexible template system will be added to facilitate dynamic template creation for the user to use in new experiments and scenarios.
